# AIOps with Elastic Stack

## Overview

Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is a way to automate tasks that are typically carried out by Site Reliability Engineers (SREs). It aims to make the lives of SREs easier by helping them:
- Reduce system noise
- Surface critical issues more efficiently
- Perform root cause analysis by correlating data from different systems

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of AIOps using the Elastic Stack. It showcases:

- Collection and analysis of logs, metrics, and traces from 11 microservices running in a Kubernetes cluster
- Techniques for noise reduction and relevant information extraction
- Utilization of Elastic Stack's powerful search capabilities to efficiently filter through massive log volumes
- Implementation of field statistics analysis to gain insights into service behaviors and logging patterns

## Features

- Integration with Kubernetes cluster
- Multi-service log aggregation
- Advanced log filtering and analysis
- Metric collection and correlation
- Distributed tracing
- Automated noise reduction
- Root cause analysis tools
